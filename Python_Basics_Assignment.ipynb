    "Q1. Explain the key features of Python that make it a popular choice for programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Python's popularity as a programming language can be attributed to several key features:\n",
    "1. Readability and Simplicity:\n",
    "  •\tClear Syntax: Python's syntax is designed to be human-readable, often resembling plain English. This makes it easier to learn and write code.\n",
    "  •\tReduced Boilerplate Code: Python's concise syntax eliminates the need for many explicit declarations and terminators, leading to more concise and       readable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Versatility and Wide Applications:\n",
    "  •\tGeneral-Purpose Language: Python can be used for a wide range of applications, including web development, data science, machine learning,               artificial intelligence, automation, and more.\n",
    "  •\tExtensive Libraries and Frameworks: Python boasts a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that simplify complex tasks, such as NumPy, Pandas,      TensorFlow, Django, and Flask.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Dynamic Typing: Python automatically infers data types at runtime, reducing the need for explicit type declarations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Cross-Platform Compatibility:\n",
    "  •\tPlatform Independence: Python code can run on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Support:\n",
    "  •\tOOP Paradigm: Python supports OOP principles like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism, making it suitable for building complex and modular     applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Functional Programming Support:\n",
    "  •\tFunctional Paradigm: Python also supports functional programming concepts like higher-order functions, lambda expressions, and map-reduce               operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Standard Library:\n",
    "  •\tBuilt-in Functionality: Python's standard library offers a rich set of modules for various tasks, including file I/O, network programming, regular      expressions, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining these features, Python has become a powerful and versatile language, making it a popular choice for both beginners and experienced programmers.\n",

These are essential for defining the structure and logic of your code. These keywords cannot be used as variable names, function/method       names, or other identifiers."
